# üìà Data analysis


## Description:
Open Food Facts is a food products database "made by everyone, for everyone".
This organisation uses an OCR (Optical Caracter Recognition) system to extract from a photograph the text of a package's list of ingredients.
The aim of this project was to automatically associate to each ingredient list (retrieved by OCR) a product category.


## Data Source: Open Food Facts CSV of 434 896 French products.

## Type of analysis:
- Data Analysis to identify 38 categories of products and their occurrences.
- Search for the best Machine Learning model to classify products automatically
- Test for Deep Learning scores

This project focuses on French products. The model had been trained on French texts from OCR.

# ‚öí Startup the project

## The initial setup.

Create virtualenv and install the project:
```bash
sudo apt-get install virtualenv python-pip python-dev
deactivate; virtualenv ~/venv ; source ~/venv/bin/activate ;\
    pip install pip -U; pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Unittest test:
```bash
make clean install test
```

Check for OpenFoodFacts in gitlab.com/{group}.
If your project is not set please add it:

- Create a new project on `gitlab.com/{group}/OpenFoodFacts`
- Then populate it:

```bash
##   e.g. if group is "{group}" and project_name is "OpenFoodFacts"
git remote add origin git@github.com:{group}/OpenFoodFacts.git
git push -u origin master
git push -u origin --tags
```

## Functionnal test with a script:

```bash
cd
mkdir tmp
cd tmp
OpenFoodFacts-run
```

# üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Install

Go to `https://github.com/{group}/OpenFoodFacts` to see the project, manage issues,
setup you ssh public key, ...

## Create a python3 virtualenv and activate it:

```bash
sudo apt-get install virtualenv python-pip python-dev
deactivate; virtualenv -ppython3 ~/venv ; source ~/venv/bin/activate
```

## Clone the project and install it:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:{group}/OpenFoodFacts.git
cd OpenFoodFacts
pip install -r requirements.txt
make clean install test                # install and test
```
## Functionnal test with a script:

```bash
cd
mkdir tmp
cd tmp
OpenFoodFacts-run
````

# Clean the data

We apply the following preprocessing:
- remove punctuation
- remove non alphabetical characters (numbers, special characters)
- remove accentuated characters
- remove extra spaces
- remove stopwords
- basic spellcheck with Levenshtein distance of 1 (optional)

# Analyse the dataset

We joined the OCR dataset with OFF full database using barcode as matching key to obtain product categories.
We chose the "PNNS 2" columns, with 38 distinct categories. PNNS stands for "Programme national nutrition sant√©", categories have been established by the French Ministry of Health.


# Train the model

Best performance was obtained with a RidgeClassifier, which we kept.

# üì∏ OCR test

To test our categorizer with new data we have implemented an OCR system.
Please, find the setup in the notebooks folder (OCR_setup.ipynb).

Two OCR system were tested: tesseract and easyocr.

## To understand how to custom parameters of tesseract see:
https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/doc/tesseract.1.asc#config-files-and-augmenting-with-user-data

## Easy OCR doesn't need custom config:
https://pypi.org/project/easyocr/


## If you wish to use those OCR in production:
- easyocr is very easy to use as its name suggests, but it's also very heavy and may be to big for plateforms like Heroku (It may exceed
  the slug size).

- To use tesseract in production you will have to change the path.
  For example, our path was pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = '/usr/local/bin/tesseract' for a local usage and pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = ‚Äò/app/.apt/usr/bin/tesseract‚Äô in production

- We ended up using tesseract in a docker image
